# ESP8266-Google-Sheets-Data-Logging

## Introduction
This content was created by Chris Nguyen for BME 201 at University of Wisconsin Madison. Its implementation in Spring 2019, marked the first time the Introduction to BME Design course began to use wireless data logging. This change eliminated common hardware failures when data logging onto an SD card. It also allowed students and instructors the ability to monitor the process wirelessly and remotely.
